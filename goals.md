# Goals

Our goal is to make the website performant, accessible, scalable and easy to use for all, so that should be kept in mind when developing every feature and page.

For BridgeMap to be considered “complete”, we will need to build the following pages:

- Directory (main landing page)
- Individual organisation page
- An about us page
- FAQ page
- Join Directory page
- Admin interface
- Contributors page
- Privacy policy page

And to have implemented/created the following:
- Accept cookie banner, if we use cookies
- Testing - frontend, backend, end to end
- Documentation when neccessary

### Possibilities for expansion

- Facilitate volunteer running workshops? for young people and organisations? 
- Opportunities for professionals to share their skills with young people. 
e.g. as a developer you can sign up on the site to run a course and once its been approved by the administrator, it will be available for young people to register onto.
- Blogging - writing competitions to encourage participation, post them on our social channels, have judges for pieces and give prizes.
