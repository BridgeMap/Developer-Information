# Tech stack 

Our plan is to let the things we do influence the technology we use. For this reason, we do not have a predefined list of technologies we will use as we presume this will need to change over time. 

We will definitely be using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The way we use these will differ depending on what we are trying to create.
